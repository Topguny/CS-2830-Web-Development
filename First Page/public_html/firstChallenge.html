	<p>Hello World!</p>
	<p>Paragraph #2</p> 
		
		
		
	<P>Third Paragraph -> this is a lot of text that we are trying to split on two separate lines, we are going to <br> 
	see if I simply add a new line or press enter, if that will separate this string on two lines in the browser. <br>

        <p>Description: I am a sophomore, who is majoring Information Technology and minoring in Computer Science. I am from St. Louis Missouri,<br>
        I went to Webster Groves High School where I graduated in 2015. I currently work for the Agricultural Department doing some coding for them,<br>
        I am not entirely sure what I want to do for a living after college, most likely something with databases or networks.</p>
        
        <p align="center">Hobbies: I play a lot of video games, from rpg's to fps games to strategy games, my favorite video game being<br>
        the Dragon Age series. I also watch a lot of movies, my favorite movie is easily Blade Runner, which has probably my favorite actor<br>
        Harrison Ford in it. I am also an avid comic book reader and collector, my favorite comic book character being Iron Man.</p>
