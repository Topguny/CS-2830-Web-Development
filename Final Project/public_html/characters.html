                            <p>Captain Samantha Carter made her first appearance in "Children of the Gods", the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, as a United States Air Force Captain who joined the fictional SG-1 team under the command of Colonel Jack O'Neill. After being promoted to Major in Season 3, Carter remained O'Neill's second-in-command until her promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel early in Season 8, at which point she assumed command of the SG-1 team and O'Neill was promoted to Brigadier-General in order to lead Stargate Command. Between Seasons 8 and 9 of SG-1, following the defeat of the Replicators and downfall of the Goa'uld system lords, she accepted a position as Head of the Stargate Research and Development Programme, based in Nevada. At the time of the emergence of the Ori, she was engaged in deep-space research but was reassigned to SG-1, now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell, on her return to Earth. Following the defeat of the Ori in Stargate: The Ark of Truth, Carter was promoted to a "full bird" Colonel and appointed as the new commander of the Atlantis expedition early in Season 4 of Atlantis. Later, Carter is given command of the Daedalus-class ship, the George Hammond.</p>

                            <h1>Teal'c</h1> 
                            <p><img width="321" height="526" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Teal%27c.jpg" alt="&quot;Enter your caption here&quot;" /></p>   		
                            <p>Played by Christopher Judge, Teal'c is a Jaffa warrior from the planet Chulak. As a Jaffa, Teal'c is a genetically modified human with an abdominal pouch that serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. The larval symbiote grants enhanced strength, health, healing, and longevity; Teal'c is around 100 years old during the show's run and ages an additional 50 years in the final SG-1 episode. Teal'c's most notable feature is a golden tattoo found on his forehead, a sign that he once served the System Lord Apophis as First Prime, the most senior Jaffa rank.
                            Teal'c is introduced in the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1, "Children of the Gods". The character appears in all episodes of SG-1 except season 8's "Prometheus Unbound", making him the character with the most episode appearances. Teal'c also appears in the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum, as well as the Stargate Atlantis season 4 episodes "Reunion" and "Midway". In 2002, Christopher Judge was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category "Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series".</p>
