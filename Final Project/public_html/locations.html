                            <p>Earth (Terra in Ancient, Midgard to the humans settled by the Asgard, Tau'ri in Goa'uld, and designated P2X-3YZ by the Tau'ri), is the home planet of the Tau'ri and the cradle of human civilization in the Milky Way. With a population of over 7 billion, Earth was one of the most populated known human worlds in both the Pegasus and Milky way galaxies. This is due to a long period of isolation from any alien contact, as well as their success in thwarting various alien attacks thanks to the staff and personnel of Stargate Command who have also successfully stopped any attacks by various enemies including the Goa'uld, Replicators, Wraith, Ori and Lucian Alliance.</p>

                            <p>Atlantis, also called the Lost City of the Ancients and the City of the Ancestors, Atlantus in Ancient, is a City-ship built by the Ancients several million years ago, which has approximately the same internal space as found in Manhattan. The Ancients left the Milky Way galaxy several million years ago for the Pegasus galaxy, taking Atlantis with them and settling on a planet they named Lantea, which became their new capital. Millions of years later, after the Lanteans, the name the Ancients came to be known by submerged the city to protect it from their enemies, the Wraith, and returned to Earth through the Stargate. Their story, over time, inspired the Tau'ri myth of Atlantis.</p>

                            <p>Abydos was the second planet reached through Earth's Stargate program (the first being Heliopolis in 1945) and possibly the first world the Goa'uld brought humans to. Abydos is a desert world, useless save for its deposits of Naquadah. When this world was under the domain of Ra, he forced the human inhabitants to mine it for him up until his eventual defeat and death. Abydos was later destroyed by Anubis in 2003.</p>

                            <p>Chulak is a planet that is approximately 2,000 light years away from Earth. It is the true home of Teal'c. The planet was originally part of Cronus' empire (proof of this are the Greek-like structures) and then was conquered by his mortal enemy, Apophis, who became the ruler of Chulak. The Jaffa Rebellion began here as the planet was the first to denounce the Goa'uld as false gods. Chulak later fell to the Ori but has presumably since been freed from their control in the aftermath of the Ori's defeat.</p>
